AI-Driven Government Complaint & Case Management System
📌 Problem Statement
In many cities and towns, citizen complaints related to essential public services such as water supply,
roads, electricity, sanitation, streetlights, and drainage are still handled through fragmented channels like
phone calls, emails, walk-in counters, or basic portals. Existing grievance systems primarily register
complaints and generate a ticket number, but they lack intelligent mechanisms for automatic
categorization, prioritization, routing to the right department, SLA-based monitoring, and analytics for
governance. As a result, high-impact issues get delayed, complaints are misrouted or manually handled,
SLA breaches go unnoticed, and citizens experience low transparency and reduced trust in public
institutions.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
Recent work on AI-driven grievance systems shows that techniques like NLP-based categorization,
urgency prediction, and AI assistants can significantly improve routing accuracy, response times, and
citizen engagement. However, many of these solutions focus on automation and do not clearly embed
human oversight, multi-layer governance, or community participation. There is a need for a centralized,
AI-assisted, role-based complaint and case management platform that supports the complete
lifecycle from complaint intake to closure, while ensuring transparency, accountability, and human
control over final decisions.[7][8][9][2][10][11][12]
This project proposes an AI-Driven Government Complaint & Case Management System built using
Django and an SQL database, which allows citizens to file complaints digitally, assists officials with AIbased categorization and prioritization, supports SLA tracking and escalation, enables community
discussion, and provides monitoring dashboards to authorities—while keeping humans in charge at every
decision point.[8][6][13]
🎯 Objectives of the Project
• To digitize and standardize the entire government grievance redressal workflow from complaint
registration to closure, with proper audit trails and SLAs.[3][6]
• To assist officials using AI-based complaint categorization, priority prediction, and routing
suggestions (not full automation).[9][7][8]
• To ensure transparency and accountability through real-time status tracking, escalation logs, and
citizen feedback mechanisms.[2][10][3]
• To improve citizen engagement using a community discussion space and an AI guidance assistant
that explains processes and status.[10][14][15]
• To provide data-driven insights (trends, hotspots, SLA reports) that support administrative and
policy-level decisions.[16][11][2]
⚙️ Key Features (Detailed)
1️⃣ Citizen Complaint Management
• Online complaint submission:
o Citizens submit complaints with category, textual description, optional attachment
(image/video link), and location (area + optional GPS coordinates).[17][3]
o Forms are mobile-friendly for easy access.
• Complaint lifecycle and tracking:
o Status flow: New → AI_Triage_Suggested → Assigned → In_Progress → Resolved (and
optional Rejected / Closed_No_Action).[6][1]
o Citizens can view a detailed timeline: who handled the complaint, when it was updated, and
what action was taken.
• Notifications:
o Email/SMS/in-app notifications when complaint is registered, assigned, updated, escalated, or
resolved (can be simulated in prototype).[14][3]
• Feedback and rating:
o After resolution, citizens rate the resolution, add comments, and mark “satisfied / not
satisfied”, feeding into analytics and quality metrics.[18][19]
2️⃣ AI-Assisted Decision Support
(All AI is assistive; officers can override suggestions.)
• Automatic complaint categorization:
o NLP model processes complaint text and predicts category (e.g., water, road, power,
sanitation, streetlight, drainage, other).[7][8][9]
• Priority prediction:
o Model predicts urgency level (Low / Medium / High) using features like keywords, sentiment,
location, and historical patterns.[11][9][7]
• SLA breach risk prediction:
o Based on current backlog, previous delays, and complaint type, the system flags complaints
that are likely to breach SLA if not acted on soon.[9][11][7]
• Department routing recommendation:
o Suggests the most appropriate department and possibly sub-unit (e.g., “Water Department →
Pipeline Maintenance”) for each complaint.[20][12][8]
• Human-in-loop:
o Officers see AI suggestions (category, priority, department) with confidence scores and can
accept, modify, or reject them; changes are logged for model improvement and audit.[21][2][10]
3️⃣ Role-Based Governance & Workflow
The platform implements a multi-role, multi-layer governance structure.
• Citizen Layer
o File and track complaints, participate in discussions, interact with AI assistant for
guidance.[14][3]
• Local Officer Layer
o Sees assigned complaints, updates status, adds field notes, attaches action photos, and records
actual resolution details.[1][3]
o Can escalate complaints to Department Admin if blocked.
• Department Admin Layer
o Manages all complaints within a specific department (e.g., Water, Roads, Electricity).[22][3]
o Assigns/reassigns complaints to officers, monitors SLA compliance, and handles escalations.
o Moderates community discussions for their department.
• City / State Authority Layer
o Read-only access to aggregated dashboards across all departments: trends, hotspots, SLA
statistics, and escalation patterns.[23][2][10]
o Uses insights for policy and planning.
• System Super Admin Layer
o Manages users, roles, departments, configuration (SLA rules, AI thresholds) and system
logs.[6][1]
o Deploys/updates AI models and monitors system health, but does not change complaint
outcomes.
Django’s authentication, groups, and permissions system will be used to enforce this role-based access
control clearly at the view and API level.[24][6]
4️⃣ Community Discussion Module
• Public issue threads:
o Citizens can create discussion threads for broader civic issues (e.g., “Water supply issue in
Ward 10”, “Garbage collection timing”).[25][14]
• Linking with complaints:
o Complaints can optionally be linked to relevant discussion threads to reduce duplicates and
centralize information.
• Officer participation:
o Local Officers and Department Admins can respond with clarifications, updates, and official
statements visible to all.
• Moderation:
o Department Admins and System Admin can moderate posts, remove abusive content, and
close threads when issues are resolved.
This module increases transparency and provides context beyond individual tickets, similar to civic-tech
initiatives that combine grievance redressal with public discourse.[10][14]
5️⃣ AI Talking Assistant (Guidance Only)
• Citizen guidance:
o Conversational assistant helps users choose the right category, explains what information to
provide, and clarifies how SLAs and escalation work.[26][2][7]
• Status explanation:
o When a citizen asks “What is happening with my complaint?”, the assistant reads status and
timeline from the database and explains it in simple language.[27][7]
• FAQs:
o Answers common questions about departments, services, timelines, and escalation rules
based on a curated knowledge base.[16][2]
• No direct actions:
o The assistant cannot close, modify, or reassign complaints; it can only guide or suggest,
reinforcing that final actions are human-controlled.[2][21][10]
6️⃣ Analytics & Monitoring Dashboards
• Department-wise statistics:
o Number of complaints received, resolved, pending, and reopened per category and per time
period.[3][6]
• SLA and escalation reports:
o SLA compliance percentage, average resolution time, and number of escalated cases by
department and area.[13][11][2]
• Hotspot and trend analysis:
o High-complaint areas (wards/localities), recurring issues, seasonal patterns (e.g., drainage
complaints in monsoon).[11][16][2]
• AI performance metrics:
o Accuracy of categorization, routing, and priority predictions, plus override statistics (how
often humans changed AI suggestions).[19][20][7]
These dashboards are built via SQL aggregation queries and visualized in Django views, inspired by
modern AI-enabled grievance dashboards.[16][2][11]
🧱 System Layers & Technology Stack
• Frontend:
o Django templates / minimal SPA (HTML, CSS, JS) for dashboards and forms.
• Backend:
o Django for REST-style APIs, business logic, role-based workflows.
• Database (SQL):
o PostgreSQL/MySQL for relational schema: Users, Roles, Departments, Complaints, SLA Rules,
AI Suggestions, Discussion Threads, Feedback, Audit Logs.[24][6]
• AI/NLP Services:
o Python models (could be separate microservice or integrated module) for categorization,
priority prediction, and FAQ answering, similar to other AI grievance systems.[8][7][9]
